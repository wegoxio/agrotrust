This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contact form emails (Resend API)

The contact form sends two emails through Resend:

- Customer confirmation email
- Internal notification email with full submission data

### 1) Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend API key
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: verified sender (for example `AgroTrust <no-reply@your-domain.com>`)
- `CONTACT_INBOX_EMAIL`: internal recipients (single email or comma-separated list)
- `RESEND_REPLY_TO` (optional): default reply-to for customer confirmation
- `SITE_URL` (optional): public site URL for logo rendering in email templates

### 2) How it works

- Client form submits to `POST /api/contact`
- Route handler validates payload and sends both emails via Resend HTTP API
- Email copy is localized (`en` / `es`) based on the active platform locale
